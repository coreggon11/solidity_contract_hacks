# Solidity Contract Hacks

This repository showcases some real exploitable contracts that I came across. For each exploit, I will include  the contract, the exploit, and the script used to perform the exploit.

## Motivation

I have created an NFT game Shibawars, which was deployed to Shibarium Network. There is some history behind this decision and you can read about it [here](https://medium.com/shibawars/burning-shib-on-shibarium-introducing-shibawars-5939c3c63661) if you are interested ðŸ˜ƒ. However since it is a pretty unused chain, not that many contracts are being deployed, and if something is deployed and verified, it is most likely a legit contract that can be used. And since I was always been somewhat drawn towards security (I have to show the others that my code would be better ðŸ˜‚), I decided that I will be looking for exploits in verified contracts on this chain. I will share them here, along with the story behind the exploit and everything you need!

If you find this helpful, be sure to [mint your Shiba gangster!](https://mint.shibawars.net) ðŸ˜ƒ (You can also play it for free but I have to use this to sell out lol)
